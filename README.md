# Football Fixture Generator and Result Simulator

This Python script generates round-robin fixtures for a football season and simulates match results based on assigned goal probabilities to each team.

## Features

- Generates fixtures for a 38 matchweek season using a round-robin algorithm.
- Assigns goal probabilities to each team based on their position in the list.
- Simulates match results by generating random scores for each team using their goal probabilities.
- Ensures the total goals in a fixture do not exceed 6 and proper error handling for score generation that exceed 6 goals.
- Team list and goal probabilities for each team can be adjusted as desired
